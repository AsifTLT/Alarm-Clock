Python Alarm Clock Project
I am excited to share my latest project—a fully functional alarm clock built using Python! 
This project showcases my skills in Python programming, time management, and user interface design.

Features:
1. Set Alarms: Easily set multiple alarms for different times.
2. Custom Alarm Sounds: Choose your favorite sound to wake up to.
3. User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design for easy use.
4. Error Handling: Robust error handling to ensure smooth operation.
   
Technologies Used:
Python: Core programming language used for developing the alarm clock.
Datetime Module: For handling date and time functions.
Playsound Module: For playing custom alarm sounds.

How It Works
Setting an Alarm: Enter the desired time for the alarm and select the alarm sound.
Alarm Activation: When the set time is reached, the alarm will sound and a notification will appear.
Stop Alarm: Turn off the alarm once you're awake and ready to start your day.

Why I Built It
I created this alarm clock project to enhance my Python programming skills and to solve a practical problem—waking up on time! 
This project allowed me to explore various Python libraries and improve my understanding of time-related functions and user interface design.
